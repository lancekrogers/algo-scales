# Algo Scales

An algorithm study tool designed for efficient interview preparation, focusing on common patterns used in technical coding interviews.

## Overview

Algo Scales is a command-line application that helps developers practice and master algorithm patterns for technical interviews. It emphasizes focused learning through curated problems organized by algorithm patterns, offering different learning modes to accommodate various study needs. The application primarily operates in CLI mode.

> **Note**: The Terminal UI mode (`--tui` flag) is currently a work in progress and may not function as expected. Please use the standard CLI mode for a stable experience.

## Features

![AlgoScales Quick Demo](demo/demo-assets/algoscales-ai-workflow-short.gif)

- **🤖 AI-Powered Assistant**: Get intelligent hints, code reviews, and pattern explanations from Claude or Ollama ([Learn more](AI_ASSISTANT.md))

- **Multiple Learning Modes**:

  - **Learn Mode**: Shows pattern explanations and detailed walkthroughs
  - **Practice Mode**: Hides solutions but allows hints on demand
  - **Cram Mode**: Rapid-fire practice with timers for interview preparation

- **Pattern-Based Learning**: Problems organized by common algorithm patterns (sliding window, two pointers, DFS, etc.)

- **Distraction-Free Environment**: Terminal-based UI keeps you focused on the problem at hand

- **Statistics Tracking**: Records your progress and performance over time

- **Configurable Timer**: Set time limits to simulate interview conditions

- **Multiple Language Support**: Practice in Go, Python, or JavaScript

### 🚧 In Development

- **Neovim Plugin**: Advanced editor integration (in development - see [algo-scales-nvim](https://github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales-nvim))
- **VS Code Extension**: IDE integration (planned)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- A terminal editor (vim, nano, etc.) configured through the `EDITOR` environment variable

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Option 1: One-line installer (no sudo required)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Option 2: Go install (if you have Go)**
```bash
# Install directly from source (no sudo required)
go install github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales@latest
```

Both methods install to user directories that are typically already in your PATH:
- `~/go/bin/algo-scales` (Go's default, usually in PATH automatically)
- `~/.local/bin/algo-scales` (standard user bin directory)

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Blockhead-Consulting/algo-scales.git
cd algo-scales

# Option 1: Install to user directory (no sudo required) - RECOMMENDED  
make install-user
# This installs to ~/go/bin or ~/.local/bin (usually already in PATH)

# Option 2: Build and see all installation options
make install

# Option 3: Just build (use with ./bin/algo-scales)
make build
```

The `make install-user` command installs AlgoScales to `~/bin/` without requiring sudo privileges. You'll need to add `~/bin` to your PATH if it's not already there.

### Download Binary

Pre-built binaries are available for the following platforms:

- Linux (x86_64)
- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Windows (x86_64)

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales/releases).

## 🤖 AI-Powered Workflow

![AlgoScales AI Workflow Demo](demo/demo-assets/algoscales-ai-workflow.gif)

AlgoScales integrates AI assistance throughout your learning journey. Here's how it works:

### 1. Start Practice Session
```bash
$ algo-scales start practice sliding-window
✓ Started session: Maximum Sum Subarray
Opening vim with problem layout...
```

### 2. Work in Your Editor with Problem Context
```
┌─ Problem ──────────────────────────┬─ solution.go ────────────────────┐
│ # Maximum Sum Subarray             │ package main                     │
│                                    │                                  │
│ **Difficulty**: Easy               │ func maxSumSubarray(arr []int,   │
│ **Pattern**: sliding-window        │                     k int) int { │

```

### 3. Get AI-Powered Hints (Progressive Difficulty)
```vim
:AlgoScalesAIHint
```
```
🤖 AI Hint:
Looking at your empty solution, let me guide you:

The sliding window pattern maintains a window of fixed size k
that slides through the array. Start by calculating the sum
of the first k elements, then slide by removing the first
element and adding the next. Track the maximum sum seen.
```

### 4. Interactive AI Chat for Deep Learning
```vim
:AlgoScalesAIChat
```
```
🤖 AI Assistant Ready!
You> What's the time complexity?

Assistant> The time complexity is O(n) where n is the array length.
We visit each element exactly once as the window slides through.
Space complexity is O(1) - only using a few variables.

You> How would this change for variable window size?

Assistant> Great question! For variable window size, you'd use
the expanding/contracting sliding window pattern. Track conditions
to grow or shrink the window dynamically. Common in substring problems.

You> exit
Goodbye! Keep practicing! 👋
```

### 5. Auto-Testing & Immediate Feedback
```
✓ Test 1 passed: [2,1,5,1,3,2], k=3 → 9
✓ Test 2 passed: [1,4,2,10,23,3,1,0,20], k=4 → 39
✓ Test 3 passed: [3,4,5,6,7,2,9,8,1], k=2 → 17
✓ Test 4 passed: Edge case - k=1

🎉 All tests passed!
```

### 6. Track Your Progress
```bash
$ algo-scales stats
📊 Your Progress:
  Patterns mastered: 3/11
  Problems solved: 15
  Current streak: 7 days 🔥
  Favorite pattern: Two Pointers
