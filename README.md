# 🎵 AlgoScales

Master algorithms through structured practice - because learning coding patterns is like learning scales.

> _"Just as a pianist must practice scales daily to perform Chopin brilliantly, a developer must practice algorithm patterns to shine in technical interviews."_

## 🚧 Project Status: MVP

AlgoScales is a functional algorithm practice tool that I built to solve my own problem: making interview prep less tedious. The core functionality works well, but the vim plugin UX needs refinement before it's something I'd use for daily practice.

Notable technical decisions:

- Built in Go for fast execution and easy distribution
- Integrated AI assistants (claude code cli/Ollama) for contextual learning
- Terminal-first to avoid web distractions
- Vim plugin because the more advanced neovim plugin isn't ready yet

**What works well:**

- ✅ Core practice modes (learn, practice, cram)
- ✅ Daily scales workflow for systematic practice
- ✅ AI-powered hints and explanations
- ✅ Progress tracking and statistics
- ✅ Vim integration for distraction-free practice

**What's still rough:**

- 🔧 Command structure could be more intuitive
- 🔧 TUI mode is incomplete
- 🔧 Some edge cases in session management
- 🔧 Documentation reflects intended design more than current state

Feel free to explore, use it for practice, or contribute improvements!

## Overview

AlgoScales applies the time-tested methodology of musical education to algorithm learning. Just as musicians build technique through daily scale practice, developers build problem-solving intuition through regular pattern practice.

### The Musical Philosophy

In music education, scales are fundamental patterns that appear in every piece of music. Musicians practice scales daily not to perform scales, but to build the muscle memory and pattern recognition needed for complex pieces. Similarly, AlgoScales teaches you the 11 fundamental algorithm patterns that appear in technical interviews:

- **🎹 Sliding Window** = C Major Scale (fundamental and versatile)
- **🎸 Two Pointers** = G Major Scale (balanced and efficient)
- **🎻 Fast & Slow Pointers** = D Major Scale (cycle detection)
- **🎺 Hash Maps** = A Major Scale (quick lookups)
- **🎷 Binary Search** = E Major Scale (divide and conquer)
- **🥁 DFS** = B Major Scale (deep exploration)
- **🎹 BFS** = F# Major Scale (level-by-level)
- **🎸 Dynamic Programming** = Db Major Scale (optimization)
- **🎻 Greedy** = Ab Major Scale (local decisions)
- **🎺 Union-Find** = Eb Major Scale (connections)
- **🎷 Heap/Priority Queue** = Bb Major Scale (ordering)

## Why AlgoScales Exists

I built AlgoScales because the tech industry values algorithmic puzzle solving skills over building software, and I always find myself needing to grind for weeks each time I need to look for a new job because I focus on building software while I'm working. Building this tool - with its CLI, AI integration, vim plugin, and test coverage - required more software engineering skill than any leetcode interview tests for. Yet here we are: I built a production-quality system to help myself remember how to reverse a linked list in a non-real world scenario. Until the industry values building over reciting, we need to play the game. AlgoScales makes that game less painful, at least for me. Also was an excuse to avoid grinding leetcode for the last few weeks.

> **Note**: The Terminal UI mode (`--tui` flag) is incomplete. Stick to CLI mode for now.

### 🚧 In Development

- **Neovim Plugin**: Advanced editor integration (in development - see [algo-scales-nvim](https://github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales-nvim))
- **VS Code Extension**: IDE integration (planned)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- A terminal editor (vim, nano, etc.) configured through the `EDITOR` environment variable

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Option 1: One-line installer (no sudo required)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Option 2: Go install (if you have Go)**

```bash
# Install directly from source (no sudo required)
go install github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales@latest
```

Both methods install to user directories that are typically already in your PATH:

- `~/go/bin/algo-scales` (Go's default, usually in PATH automatically)
- `~/.local/bin/algo-scales` (standard user bin directory)

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Blockhead-Consulting/algo-scales.git
cd algo-scales

# Option 1: Install to user directory (no sudo required) - RECOMMENDED
make install-user
# This installs to ~/go/bin or ~/.local/bin (usually already in PATH)

# Option 2: Build and see all installation options
make install

# Option 3: Just build (use with ./bin/algo-scales)
make build
```

The `make install-user` command installs AlgoScales to `~/bin/` without requiring sudo privileges. You'll need to add `~/bin` to your PATH if it's not already there.

### Download Binary

Pre-built binaries are available for the following platforms:

- Linux (x86_64)
- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Windows (x86_64)

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales/releases).

```

### 3. Get AI-Powered Hints (Progressive Difficulty)

```vim
:AlgoScalesAIHint
```

```
🤖 AI Hint:
Looking at your empty solution, let me guide you:

The sliding window pattern maintains a window of fixed size k
that slides through the array. Start by calculating the sum
of the first k elements, then slide by removing the first
element and adding the next. Track the maximum sum seen.
```

### 4. Interactive AI Chat for Deep Learning

```vim
:AlgoScalesAIChat
```

```
🤖 AI Assistant Ready!
You> What's the time complexity?

Assistant> The time complexity is O(n) where n is the array length.
We visit each element exactly once as the window slides through.
Space complexity is O(1) - only using a few variables.

You> How would this change for variable window size?

Assistant> Great question! For variable window size, you'd use
the expanding/contracting sliding window pattern. Track conditions
to grow or shrink the window dynamically. Common in substring problems.

You> exit
Goodbye! Keep practicing! 👋
```

### 5. Auto-Testing & Immediate Feedback

```
✓ Test 1 passed: [2,1,5,1,3,2], k=3 → 9
✓ Test 2 passed: [1,4,2,10,23,3,1,0,20], k=4 → 39
✓ Test 3 passed: [3,4,5,6,7,2,9,8,1], k=2 → 17
✓ Test 4 passed: Edge case - k=1

🎉 All tests passed!
```

## Usage

### First Run

The first time you run Algo Scales, you'll be asked to enter your license key and email. After validation, the tool will download the problem sets.

```bash
./algo-scales
```

By default, Algo Scales runs in CLI mode.

### AI Assistant Setup (Optional)

Enhance your learning with AI-powered hints and explanations:

```bash
# Configure AI provider (Claude or Ollama)
./algo-scales ai config

# Get intelligent hints while solving problems
./algo-scales hint --ai

# Get AI code review for your solution
./algo-scales review --ai

# Start interactive AI chat
./algo-scales hint --ai --interactive

# Test AI configuration
./algo-scales ai test
```

#### Configuring Context Window Size

For Ollama users, you can adjust the context window size to prevent system prompt truncation:

```bash
# Set context window to 120k tokens (recommended for llama3.2)
./algo-scales ai config set ollama.num_ctx 120000

# Set smaller context window to conserve memory
./algo-scales ai config set ollama.num_ctx 32768

# View current configuration
./algo-scales ai config get ollama.num_ctx
```

**Model-specific recommendations:**
- **llama3.2**: 120,000 tokens (default)
- **llama3.1**: 8,192 tokens  
- **codellama**: 16,384 tokens
- **mixtral**: 32,768 tokens

**Note**: Larger context windows use more memory but prevent AI responses from losing important context like the system prompt.

See the [AI Assistant Guide](AI_ASSISTANT.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.
