# Algo Scales

An algorithm study tool designed for efficient interview preparation, focusing on common patterns used in technical coding interviews.

## Overview

Algo Scales is a command-line application that helps developers practice and master algorithm patterns for technical interviews. It emphasizes focused learning through curated problems organized by algorithm patterns, offering different learning modes to accommodate various study needs. The application primarily operates in CLI mode.

> **Note**: The Terminal UI mode (`--tui` flag) is currently a work in progress and may not function as expected. Please use the standard CLI mode for a stable experience.

## Features

- **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Assistant**: Get intelligent hints, code reviews, and pattern explanations from Claude or Ollama ([Learn more](AI_ASSISTANT.md))

- **Multiple Learning Modes**:

  - **Learn Mode**: Shows pattern explanations and detailed walkthroughs
  - **Practice Mode**: Hides solutions but allows hints on demand
  - **Cram Mode**: Rapid-fire practice with timers for interview preparation

- **Pattern-Based Learning**: Problems organized by common algorithm patterns (sliding window, two pointers, DFS, etc.)

- **Distraction-Free Environment**: Terminal-based UI keeps you focused on the problem at hand

- **Statistics Tracking**: Records your progress and performance over time

- **Configurable Timer**: Set time limits to simulate interview conditions

- **Multiple Language Support**: Practice in Go, Python, or JavaScript

### ðŸš§ In Development

- **Neovim Plugin**: Advanced editor integration (in development - see [algo-scales-nvim](https://github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales-nvim))
- **VS Code Extension**: IDE integration (planned)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- A terminal editor (vim, nano, etc.) configured through the `EDITOR` environment variable

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Option 1: One-line installer (no sudo required)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Option 2: Go install (if you have Go)**
```bash
# Install directly from source (no sudo required)
go install github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales@latest
```

Both methods install to user directories that are typically already in your PATH:
- `~/go/bin/algo-scales` (Go's default, usually in PATH automatically)
- `~/.local/bin/algo-scales` (standard user bin directory)

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Blockhead-Consulting/algo-scales.git
cd algo-scales

# Option 1: Install to user directory (no sudo required) - RECOMMENDED  
make install-user
# This installs to ~/go/bin or ~/.local/bin (usually already in PATH)

# Option 2: Build and see all installation options
make install

# Option 3: Just build (use with ./bin/algo-scales)
make build
```

The `make install-user` command installs AlgoScales to `~/bin/` without requiring sudo privileges. You'll need to add `~/bin` to your PATH if it's not already there.

### Download Binary

Pre-built binaries are available for the following platforms:

- Linux (x86_64)
- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Windows (x86_64)

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/lancekrogers/algo-scales/releases).

## Usage

### First Run

The first time you run Algo Scales, you'll be asked to enter your license key and email. After validation, the tool will download the problem sets.

```bash
./algo-scales
```

By default, Algo Scales runs in CLI mode.

### AI Assistant Setup (Optional)

Enhance your learning with AI-powered hints and explanations:

```bash
# Configure AI provider (Claude or Ollama)
./algo-scales ai config

# Get intelligent hints while solving problems
./algo-scales hint --ai

# Get AI code review for your solution
./algo-scales review --ai

# Start interactive AI chat
./algo-scales hint --ai --interactive

# Test AI configuration
./algo-scales ai test
```

See the [AI Assistant Guide](AI_ASSISTANT.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

### Available Commands

```bash
# Start a session in Learn mode
./algo-scales start learn [problem-id]

# Start a session in Practice mode
./algo-scales start practice [problem-id]

# Start a session in Cram mode (rapid-fire problems)
./algo-scales start cram

# List all available problems
./algo-scales list

# List problems by pattern
./algo-scales list patterns

# List problems by difficulty

## In-Session Commands

When in a practice session, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- `e`: Open your code in the configured editor
- `h`: Show hints (if available)
- `s`: Show solution (if available)
- `Enter`: Submit your solution
- `n`: Skip to the next problem
