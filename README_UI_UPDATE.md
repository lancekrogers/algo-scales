# Enhanced UI for Algo Scales

This update introduces an enhanced terminal user interface for Algo Scales, making the application more interactive, visually appealing, and engaging for users.

## New Features

### Rich Terminal UI

- **Interactive Navigation**: Navigate through problems, patterns, and modes with keyboard controls
- **Split-Screen Layout**: View problem statements and code side by side
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code is displayed with language-specific syntax highlighting
- **Pattern Visualizations**: Visual representations of algorithm patterns help reinforce concepts
- **Musical Theme**: Consistent with the Neovim plugin's musical scale metaphor

### Gamification Elements

- **Achievement System**: Track progress and unlock achievements as you master patterns
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: See your improvement across different algorithm patterns
- **Detailed Statistics**: Visualize your learning journey with comprehensive stats

### Educational Enhancements

- **Pattern-Specific Styling**: Each algorithm pattern has its own color theme
- **ASCII/Unicode Visualizations**: See how algorithms work with visual representations
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Get immediate visual feedback on test results

## Architecture

The enhanced UI is built using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

- **Model**: Manages application state and data structures
- **View**: Handles rendering and visual presentation
- **Controller**: Processes user input and updates the model

## Dependencies

This update introduces the following dependencies:

- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea): Terminal UI framework
- [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss): Style definitions
- [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles): Common UI components
- [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma): Syntax highlighting

## Usage

The enhanced UI is now the default interface. Simply run:

```bash
./algo-scales
```

For compatibility with scripts or the Neovim plugin, the legacy CLI interface can still be accessed with:

```bash
./algo-scales --cli
```

## Compatibility

- All existing command-line flags and options continue to work
- The Neovim plugin integration is maintained
- Script automation is supported through the legacy CLI mode

## Future Improvements

This UI enhancement lays the groundwork for future features:

- AI-assisted hints with visual explanations
- Interactive algorithm animations
- Customizable themes and layouts
- Additional gamification elements

## Technical Notes

The implementation follows a gradual enhancement approach that maintains all existing functionality while progressively adding new visual and interactive elements. The UI is built on modern terminal capabilities while maintaining compatibility with standard terminal emulators.
