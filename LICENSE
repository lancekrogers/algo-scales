🎵 Preamble: A Better Way to Practice
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
AlgoScales was born from frustration with LeetCode. After years of studying
algorithms, I found myself cramming for interviews using tools that felt like
grinding rather than practicing. Web browsers are distraction machines - ads,
notifications, tabs. This CLI brings the joy of musical practice to algorithm
review in the terminal, where focus lives. Structured, progressive, and actually
enjoyable.
